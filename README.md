# ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Power Generation Prediction Using Machine Learning üåç

This project explores a machine-learning-based approach to predict solar power generation with high accuracy, achieving a **99% AUC** (Area Under the Curve). The model's objective is to provide reliable predictions on solar energy output, helping energy providers optimize their resources, reduce costs, and enhance system efficiency.

## üîç Project Highlights

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: High-quality data is gathered from multiple sources, including historical solar generation, weather data, and solar irradiance measurements. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, remove outliers, and normalize the dataset, ensuring consistency for model training.

- **Feature Selection**: Key features‚Äîsuch as ambient temperature, module temperature, wind speed, and solar irradiance‚Äîare selected based on their relevance in influencing solar power output.

- **Modeling & Evaluation**: Machine learning algorithms, including **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**, are trained on a comprehensive dataset. The models are evaluated using AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a Random Forest model achieving the highest accuracy (99% AUC).

- **Deployment**: The trained model is deployed in a production environment to provide real-time predictions, enabling energy companies to anticipate and respond to power generation needs based on forecasted weather and irradiance data.

## üéØ Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable machine learning model for predicting solar power generation, enabling energy companies and solar plant operators to optimize energy management. By utilizing high-quality data from weather conditions, solar irradiance, and historical generation patterns, the project aims to enhance operational efficiency, reduce energy costs, and improve decision-making. This approach also helps to forecast power generation in real-time with high accuracy, offering a **99% AUC** performance, thus supporting more sustainable and cost-effective energy production.

## üå± Project Motivation

Solar energy, while sustainable, presents challenges due to initial investment costs and the dependency on weather conditions. By accurately predicting solar power output, this project aims to alleviate these barriers and assist in the efficient integration of solar power into the energy grid. The use of machine learning models helps to factor in daily variations in weather, time, and location, making it possible to predict solar generation with greater precision.
